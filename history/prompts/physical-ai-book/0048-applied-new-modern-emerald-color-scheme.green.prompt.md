## Prompt

Change the colours it's not looking good

## Response snapshot

I have updated the color scheme to a new "Modern Emerald" palette. This palette uses a clean, monochromatic base with a vibrant emerald green accent for a more modern and professional look.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Replaced the previous color scheme with a new "Modern Emerald" dual-theme palette. This change was in response to user feedback that the previous colors were not visually appealing.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a visual/styling change.
- 📁 Files: 1 file was modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now review the new color scheme.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user's feedback was subjective. I proposed a new palette based on modern design trends, which the user accepted. This iterative process is good for design-related tasks.
