# Humanoid Movement Systems

This module explores the complex mechanics of humanoid robot movement. We cover kinematics, dynamics, and the control strategies necessary to achieve stable and agile motion in anthropomorphic robots.

## Topics Covered:

*   Forward and inverse kinematics
*   Dynamics of multi-link systems
*   Balance and gait generation
*   Actuation and sensing in humanoid robots
*   Underactuated systems and compliance
