# Historical Context and Evolution

The dream of creating artificial beings with physical forms dates back to ancient mythology. However, the scientific pursuit of Physical AI began in the 20th century with the advent of cybernetics and early robotics.

- **1940s-1950s: Cybernetics:** Pioneers like Norbert Wiener and W. Grey Walter explored the connections between machines, animals, and control systems, laying the theoretical groundwork for intelligent, interactive systems.
- **1960s-1970s: Early Robots:** The development of the first industrial robots like Unimate marked the beginning of automated physical tasks. Shakey the Robot at Stanford Research Institute was one of the first mobile robots to reason about its own actions.
- **1980s-1990s: Behavior-Based Robotics:** Researchers like Rodney Brooks challenged the traditional symbolic AI approach, advocating for building robots from the ground up with simple, reactive behaviors that interact with the environment.
- **2000s-Present: The AI Revolution:** Advances in machine learning, sensor technology, and computational power have fueled explosive growth in Physical AI. Humanoid robots from companies like Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics demonstrate remarkable locomotion and manipulation capabilities, while autonomous vehicles are becoming increasingly common.
