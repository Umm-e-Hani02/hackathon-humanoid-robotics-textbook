# Applications in Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots, powered by Physical AI, are being developed for a wide range of applications that leverage their ability to operate in human-centric environments.

- **Logistics and Warehousing:** Humanoids can perform tasks like box lifting, sorting, and transporting goods, working alongside humans in warehouses and factories.
- **Healthcare:** They can assist with patient care, serve as companions for the elderly, or perform delicate surgical procedures.
- **Exploration and Disaster Response:** Humanoids can be deployed in environments that are too dangerous for humans, such as disaster sites, nuclear facilities, or space.
- **Entertainment and Hospitality:** From acting as tour guides to providing interactive entertainment, humanoids are finding roles in the service industry.
- **Personal Assistance:** In the future, humanoids may become common in homes, assisting with chores and daily tasks.
