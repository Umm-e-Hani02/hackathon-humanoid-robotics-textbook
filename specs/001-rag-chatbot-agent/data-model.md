# Data Model: RAG Agent for Chatbot

## Entities

### User Query
-   **Description**: The natural language text input provided by the user to the chatbot.
-   **Fields**:
    -   `text`: `string` (The user's question or statement.)

### Book Data Embeddings
-   **Description**: Vector representations of discrete sections (e.g., paragraphs, chapters) of the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robots" book data. These vectors are used for semantic similarity search.
-   **Storage**: Qdrant vector database.
-   **Fields**:
    -   `vector`: `array of float` (The high-dimensional embedding vector.)
    -   `metadata`: `object` (Contains contextual information about the book section, e.g., `chapter_title`, `page_number`, `source_url`, `content_text`.)

### Retrieved Sections
-   **Description**: Specific text passages or chunks from the book data identified by the RAG agent as semantically relevant to a given User Query.
-   **Fields**:
    -   `text`: `string` (The content of the retrieved section.)
    -   `score`: `float` (Similarity score from the vector database, indicating relevance.)
    -   `metadata`: `object` (Contextual information inherited from the Book Data Embeddings, e.g., `chapter_title`, `page_number`.)

### Chatbot Response
-   **Description**: The synthesized answer generated by the RAG agent, presented back to the user. This response integrates information from the Retrieved Sections.
-   **Fields**:
    -   `answer`: `string` (The natural language response to the user's query.)
    -   `sources`: `array of object` (References to the Retrieved Sections used to formulate the answer, including `text` and `metadata` for traceability.)
    -   `confidence_score`: `float` (Optional: An indicator of the agent's confidence in its answer, derived from retrieval scores and generation quality.)
