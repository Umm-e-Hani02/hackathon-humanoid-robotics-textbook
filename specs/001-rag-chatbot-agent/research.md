# Research for RAG Agent for Chatbot

## Constraints

-   **Decision**: Research required to understand typical memory usage patterns and cold start times for FastAPI applications integrating Qdrant for vector search and the OpenAI Agents SDK for agent orchestration.
-   **Rationale**: To establish realistic operational constraints and non-functional requirements (NFRs) beyond the initial performance goals (SC-002). This research will inform deployment strategies and infrastructure sizing.
-   **Alternatives considered**: None at this stage, as the information is foundational for further planning.
