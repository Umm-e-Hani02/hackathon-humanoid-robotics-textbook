I understand the "Emerald + Dark Grey" theme wasn't to your liking. I can suggest some alternative color schemes for your Docusaurus site. Please choose one of the following, or let me know if you have a different preference:

**Option 1: Blue & Orange (Material Inspired)**
*   **Light Mode Primary:** `#2196F3` (a vibrant blue)
*   **Dark Mode Primary:** `#FF9800` (a bright orange)

**Option 2: Purple & Green (Calm & Modern)**
*   **Light Mode Primary:** `#9C27B0` (a medium purple)
*   **Dark Mode Primary:** `#4CAF50` (a medium green)

**Option 3: Monochromatic Grey (Professional)**
*   **Light Mode Primary:** `#607D8B` (a bluish-grey)
*   **Dark Mode Primary:** `#424242` (a dark grey)

Once you choose, I will update the `custom.css` file accordingly and show you how to run the development server to preview the changes.
